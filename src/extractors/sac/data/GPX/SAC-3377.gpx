    <name>Arolla  Cabane des Dix</name>
    <desc>Ascend the ski slopes or take the lift to the Fontanesses top station From here ascend westward later northwest then westward once more on steeper ground which  leads up to the Pas de Chevres From the pass remove skis and descend the iron stairs Slide down then skin up along the remnant glaciers edge until a deep trough merges more or less into the main surface Cross out onto the dying Glacier de Cheilons broad expanse and head for the snow slope south of the rocks on which the Cabane des Dix is perched The slope is steeper nearer to the hut so give it a wide berth and keep further south before arcing round at the top onto the plateaux and making your way back northward to the hut</desc>
